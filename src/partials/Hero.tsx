            The purpose of this site is to act as a hub for all things 
            related to me, Jon Gander. The scope of this site allows a mixure of 
            personal and professional life, but in practice it will mostly be my
            career and code ramblings.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some parts of the site may be broken, experimental, or subject to 
            frequent change. This is intentional, as this environment allows for
            valuable learning from low-risk failure, and easy corrective 
            iteration. That said, I will aim to keep the core functionality 
            (this page and the {' '}
            <a className="text-pipboy-light hover:underline" href="/blog/">
              blog
            </a>) 
            simple, stable, and fast.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Enjoy!
          </p>
